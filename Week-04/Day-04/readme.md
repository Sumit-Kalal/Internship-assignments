# Week-04, Day-04
Today's assignment was to build a full system that not only intakes the information but also stores it in a database. 
- I started by creating a server in Django, it was very simple done by python.
- Next I created the HTML pages to take in the information and display it.
- Then I made the database in Django which was sqlite3, I made a separate "myapp" folder inside which I added the HTML codes for both the websites and wrote views, urls and models in python to let Django know where I wanted it to look for the website's code.
- Connected the websites to eachother, the database was working well. Since the default server page empty, I redirected it to the add students website.
