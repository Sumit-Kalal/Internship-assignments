# Week-04, Day-02
Today's assignment was to create a database using MySQL or SQLite and add a few tables with some details in the database.
- I used SQLite to create the required tables namely Users, Students and Tasks. Then inserted the values via the Sqlite3 shell and fetched all the contents of the table.
