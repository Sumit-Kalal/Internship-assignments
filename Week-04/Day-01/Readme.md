# Week-04 Day-01
Today's assignment was to use either Django or Flask to create and run a server to display a simple welcome page. I learnt how to set up Django, setting up and running a server and displaying a welcome message. 
- To navigate to the server page, clone the repository, set up the required environment and run the server. You will can visit the page in your browser. This is possible because of the main changes reside in "myapp/views.py" and "myapp/urls.py".
