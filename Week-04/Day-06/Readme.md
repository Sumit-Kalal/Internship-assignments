# Week-04, Day-06
- Today's assignment was to create a CRUD system.
- I did many things similar to last couple of days, creating server, adding the database, adding the html pages and connecting it all via model, view and urls.
- The main component was adding the extra functions to edit and delete the entries. 
- Creating, adding, editing and deleting can all be done using this module.
