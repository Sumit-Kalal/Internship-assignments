# Week-04, Day-05
- Today's assignment was to build a system that authenticates a user who is trying to login to his account.
- This was done by creating a server in Django, 4 html pages for Registration, Login, Home Page and user list. Then creating a database to hold in all the added users.
- I created a folder to hold all the websites and their connection necessary code. I wrote a model file that creates copies of the information needed for registration and login. Then I wrote views that contain a function retaining the input and redirecting the user to login and registration pages. In urls I added the routes that will be used by Django to redirect the user. Migrated the files to Django, creating a database.
- In setting of the login_system "myapp" was added an additional app. Urls were connected to myapp.
- Running the server, all the operation and made and verified.
