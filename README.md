This repository is a record of my activities and assignments during my intership. Everyday new folders will have new tasks and codes.
The 1st is the personal details file, which is used to print out details.
The 2nd file is used for simple arithmatic operations.
The 3rd, 4th and 5th files are for finding if the number is even or odd, finding the largest number of the bunch and determination of results based on marks respectively.
